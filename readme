xvvm - dwm with new features like:
	Desktop scrolling;
	No animation for moving and resizing windows;
	Other.
Changes are made because of my WM using experience.
I tried to make it even simpler than it was.

To understand usage of it(hotkeys etc.) read "config.h". Comments will help you.

Before installation check "mkconfig" and set variables for your system
and additional compiler flags by your wish.
To install:
	# mk install
Yes, you need mk for it. You can get in "plan9port" or somewhere else.

In order to connect xvvm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:
    $ DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 startx [xinitrc_path] xvvm
(This will start xvvm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

The WM name is showed in right up corner of screen when running. 
It can be changed by:
    $ xsetroot -name [string]
So you can change it with scripts as you wish.
Mostly it looks like:
	while xsetroot -name [some_evaluating_stuff] ; do
		sleep [time_between changings]
	done &
In other scripts(Read about "xinitrc" file).

P. S. I love you, Suckless. Thank you.
